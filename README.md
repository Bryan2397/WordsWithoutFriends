# WordsWithoutFriends
<p>Ran this in Ubuntu and wrote it in Notepad++, Must enter this in your local browswer:http://localhost:8000/words after running in Ubuntu.</p>
<p></p>Requires /root/ in ubuntu as a command line argument when running so that the program can find the text file to make a linked list of the text file and the words you need to find</p>
<p>Serves files if you choose not to play the game runs in a loop and will give you a congradulations when you find all the words.</p>
<p>I am still making adjustments to improve the gameplay and bugs in my code.</p>
